According to <a href = "https://6fefcbb86e61af1b2fc4-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/004/072/original/CDP_Supply_Chain_Report_2019.pdf?1550490556">**CDP's Supply Chain Report 2019**</a>, the CDP(Carbon Disclosure Project) **Supply Chain program**
has **continuously grown** its impact **over** the **past
decade**. Since its **launch in 2008 with 14 members**,
the program has **now expanded to** bring together
**115 major** purchasing **organizations around** the
**world**, collectively **representing** **US$3.3 trillion** in
**procurement** **spend**. 

The **lesson** from a decade of the CDP Supply Chain
program **is** that large **public and private sector**
organizations really **can lead effective change**
**through** using **their** substantial **procurement spend** as
a powerful lever for action. **If others** can **follow** their
example, and **suppliers continue to cascade good
practices** and commitments further **down the supply
chain**, **this** can **play** a **huge role in the rapid transition**
**to** a **sustainable, low carbon economy**.

So in **summary**, there is **there is direct impact on environment** in supply chain program. Most **companies** begin with the best **intentions** to **achieve successful** and **sustainable supply chain cost** management, but **somehow** seem to **lose** **momentum**, only to **see costs increase** against in **short order**. The **supply chain process** should be **handled** in such a way that there is **minimum impact** on **environment** while **covering maximum profit**. 

**<h4>Note:</h4>** In this case study we will be **ignoring** the **study of environmental factors** because **most** of the **companies don't disclose** their **reports** on environmental impacts and only **focusing** on the **profit accquirement**.
