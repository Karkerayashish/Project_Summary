# **Introduction**

According to [ CDP's Supply Chain Report 2019](https://6fefcbb86e61af1b2fc4-c70d8ead6ced550b4d987d7c03fcdd1d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/cms/reports/documents/000/004/072/original/CDP_Supply_Chain_Report_2019.pdf?1550490556) **Supply Chain program**
has **continuously grown** its impact **over** the **past
decade**. Since its **launch in 2008 with 14 members**,
the program has **now expanded to** bring together
**115 major** purchasing **organizations around** the
**world**, collectively **representing** **US$3.3 trillion** in
**procurement** **spend**. 

The **lesson** from a decade of the CDP Supply Chain
program **is** that large **public and private sector**
organizations really **can lead effective change**
**through** using **their** substantial **procurement spend** as
a powerful lever for action. **If others** can **follow** their
example, and **suppliers continue to cascade good
practices** and commitments further **down the supply
chain**, **this** can **play** a **huge role in the rapid transition**
**to** a **sustainable, low carbon economy**.
